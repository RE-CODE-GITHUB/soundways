    <h2>Quick Start</h2>

    <p>
        Make sure you have included the latest version of jQuery in your page as well as the MediaBox javascript and css
        file. After that itâ€™s really simple, just add the following code to your page:
    </p>
<pre>
    <code>
        // myPlaylist should be an array with the songs that should be loaded into the player.
        var player = $('body').ttwClarityPlayer(myPlaylist);
    </code>
</pre>

    <p>To customize Clarity, just pass in an object containing your desired options</p>
<pre>
    <code>
        var player = $('body').ttwClarityPlayer(myPlaylist, {
            styleType:'solid-blue',
            layout:'album-cover-wall'
        });
    </code>
</pre>

                href="options.html">Options</a></li>
